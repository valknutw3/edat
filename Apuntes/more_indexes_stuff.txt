First we create a new index that has the primary key and the position of the tuple
	obviously we order this index by the primary key

Then we create an index for each one of the columns, atributes of the realtion
	and again we order them. This way we will have quick access  to all tuples
	when searching by any of the atributes.
	This indexes have the primary key on one column and the corresponding atr
	on the other.


Insertion is pretty intuitive, we just insert stuff, done.
When we delete we take away the tuple  from the db and then we ONLY MODIFY THE FIRST
	INDEX, we assign the deleted record to null and thats it. We will leave data
	about the removed tuple on the other records
R = {ssn, name, age, city}
